<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm an aspiring programmer with a diverse background in translation and editing.<br> 
  I have had the privilege of working at TRANS TV as a translator for two and a half years 
  and then at Bytedance for one and a half years as a book editor. 
  However, my true passion has always been technology, which I've been fascinated with since I was a child. 
  Now, I am embarking on an exciting journey to transition into the world of programming. 
  I am eager to apply my language skills and editorial expertise in this new domain, 
  and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that programming offers. With my past experiences 
  and unwavering curiosity, I am determined to thrive and contribute meaningfully 
  in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Together with my passion for problem-solving and creative thinking, 
  I am ready to take on new challenges and embrace the opportunities that await me in the programming field. 
  Let's build a better tomorrow through code!</p>
